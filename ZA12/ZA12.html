        <h3 id="1">1. Basic Description</h3>
        <p>
            ZA 12 is a 12 bit toy ISA and verilog SOC soft core I designed for fun.
            <br>
            It has 8 general, 1 compare (0x8) and 1 return value (0x9) 12 bit registers and a program counter.
            <br>
            It contains two ROM chips on package, one for user code and one for virtual instructions and a RAM chip.
            <br>
            All of them contain 4096 32 bit big-endian addresses.
            <br>
            At this point, the roadmap includes implementing I/O, byte size operations, interrupts, a FPU and full duplex UART.
            <br>
            The development and testing is getting performed on a sipeed Tang Primer 20k FPGA board using Godwin's toolchain.
            <br>
            This is an active document and it will get updated as new features get implemented.

        <p>
            The ZA 12 package contains a ROM chip with software implemented functions.
            <br>
            To call them the developers must populate the input registers indicated on the particular function definition and the return value register.
            <br>
            Once that is done, the virtual instruction can be invoked using either the mswt or mswti instruction, 
            <br>
            the difference being if you jump to the immediate or register value function indicated on the first operand.
            <br>
            Once the virtual function has ended, execution returns to the address indicated on the return value register.

        <h3 id="3">3. Assembler</h3>
        <p>
            To help test the CPU, an assembler was built to convert ZAsm to Intel Hex.
        </p>
        <h4 id="3_1">3.1. Assembler syntax</h4>
        <p>
            A ZAsm file is composed of instructions, tag definitions and comments.
            <br>
            All comments, tag definitions and instructions must end on ";"
            <br>
            Comments start with "#" and are ignored by the assembler.
            <br>
            Tag definitions start with "." and register a memory position that can be referenced by operands.
            <br>
            An instruction has the following format:
            <br>
            <br>
            <b>PREFIX.ASM_NAME:[FIRST_OPERAND,SECOND_OPERAND];</b>
            <br>
            <br>
            Adding the prefix "sync." to the load and store instructions adds two nop:[]; instructions after the operation to wait for the read or write to take place.
            <br>
            <br>
            The operands can be a number, which depending on the instruction can be an immediate or register number or a string which can be a tag name or macro.
            <br>
            Operand macros start with "@" and are the following:
            <br>
            <ul>
                <li>@cmp: 0x8, the compare register</li>
                <li>@ret: 0x9, the return value register</li>
                <li>@skipAddr: current_address+2, useful to setup the return value to the next instruction after a jump</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <h4 id="3_2">3.2. Assembler Live Demo</h4>

            The ZA 12 ISA has a reference SOC written in Verilog named ZA P1/12, which is currently under heavy development and will be available to the general public on a later date.

            As of 2024-04-24, the schematic for the SOC looks like this:
